6. Save your API key
Next, you will see your secret key that has been generated. Make sure to copy your secret key and paste it into whatever application you need it for.
It's very important that you copy this key and save it somewhere secure, as you won't be able to retrieve it again for security reasons. You'll need this key to authenticate your applications with OpenAI's services.

7. Set up billing
OpenAI charges for use of its API on a usage basis, so, if you haven't already set up a payment method for billing, you'll need to do so. Otherwise, the API Key you just created won't work.
To set up billing, click Billing on the left menu then click Payment methods.
